                    You can use the event triggered by an Intersection Observer

                This article text is just like the ones from the last section.

                This <code>{"<ArticleText>"}</code> component causes an alert to
                show when scrolled into view!
                <br /><br />
                Notice that nothing changes about this particular
                <code>{"<ArticleText>"}</code> component itself.

                Think of the Intersection Observer event trigger like any other
                event:
                <ul>
                    <li>a <code>mouseover</code> event</li>
                    <li>a <code>mouseclick</code> event</li>
                    <li>a keyboard key being pressed</li>
                </ul>
                Any of these kinds of events can be used to trigger any action you
                want to take on the page.
