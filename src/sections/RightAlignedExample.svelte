                Here's an example chart using
                <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a>!
            </p>
            <p>
                ðŸ“ˆ <strong>Highcharts</strong> is a super-flexible library for
                creating all kinds of charts. See demos of different chart types
                <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/demo">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since we're using Highcharts through Svelte, the syntax is a
                little different from what you might see in the demos. But all
                of Highcharts' functionality is available through the Highcharts
                for Svelte package.
            </p>
            <p>
                The configuration is done through the
                <code>options</code> json object passed to the chart, which you'll
                see in the source code for this template.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use the
                <a href="https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/"
                    >API reference</a
                >
                to understand what each element in the <code>options</code> object
                does.

            <ArticleText>
                This is a <strong>basic example</strong> of how you might create
                a scrollytelling piece using Svelte and Highcharts.
            </ArticleText>

            <ArticleText>
                You can use this template as a <strong>starting point</strong>
                for your project.
                <br /><br />
                Or, if you want to build something from scratch, you can use it as
                a <strong>reference</strong> for specific functionality.
            </ArticleText>

            <ArticleText>
                This is <strong>just one way</strong> that scrollytelling can
                look.
